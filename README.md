# 🧠 AI Learning Repository – My AI Journey 🚀

Welcome to AI Learning – my personal hub for exploring, building, and experimenting with Artificial Intelligence projects.
This repository documents my journey through learning, developing, and integrating AI into real-world applications — from beginner experiments to advanced AI-powered tools.

It’s not just about writing code – it’s about understanding **how AI works**, integrating **state-of-the-art models**, and developing **practical AI-powered applications** from scratch.
Think of it as my AI diary, but with actual working code.

  ## 📚 What’s Inside
This repo contains:

- **AI-powered projects** I’ve built while learning new concepts.  
- **Experiments** with LLMs, LangChain, LangGraph, and APIs.  
- **Step-by-step progression** from fundamentals to advanced AI applications.  
- **Clean, documented code** so future-me (and maybe you) can understand it.
